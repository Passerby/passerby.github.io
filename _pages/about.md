I'm Rui Du. I’m currently seeking an opportunity to pursue a PhD in the United States or Canada. With an undergraduate degree in Computer Science 🧑‍🎓and a **decade** of work experience💼, I've carved a niche in the tech world. My journey began with **six years** in backend development and big data system maintenance, where I honed my skills as a Software Development Engineer (**SDE**).

The turning point came with my foray into Reinforcement Learning (RL) in 2019. My initial project involved replicating OpenAI's Dota 2 paper using Proximal Policy Optimization (**PPO**), sparking a deep passion for this technology. Since then, I've explored various realms within **RL**, including **Multi-Agent** 🤖 and **Game AI bots** 🎮. Lately, with the rise of Large Language Models (**LLMs**), I've shifted my focus to research in **RLHF**.

As I continue my journey, I am dedicated to exploring new directions, perspectives, and frontiers in technology. My aim is to contribute to building a new, secure, powerful, and extraordinary AI that can transform our understanding and interaction with the world.
